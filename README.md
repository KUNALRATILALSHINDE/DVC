# 🗃️ Exploring DVC – Version Control for Data & Models

Welcome to my DVC journey! This project is a deep dive into **Data Version Control (DVC)** — an open-source tool that brings versioning to datasets, models, and ML pipelines just like Git does for code.

From organizing data to creating reproducible ML pipelines, DVC has completely changed how I think about building ML projects. 💡

## 📌 Why DVC?

- 🔁 Reproducibility of experiments
- 📦 Version control for data, models, and metrics
- ⚙️ Easy collaboration without pushing heavy files to Git
- 🔄 Clean and modular ML pipelines

## 🌱 What I Explored

### ✅ The Basics
- Installing and initializing DVC (`dvc init`)
- Tracking datasets using:
  ```bash
  dvc add data/train.csv
